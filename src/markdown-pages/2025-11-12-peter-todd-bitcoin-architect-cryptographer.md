## 💡 Main Technical Contributions

### 🔒 BIP 65: OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV)

**Link:** [BIP 65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki)

One of Todd's most important contributions to the Bitcoin protocol. This operation code enables:

- **Time-locked transactions:** Transactions can be programmed to be valid only after a specific date/block
- **Enhanced smart contracts:** Allows creating more complex conditions in transactions
- **Use cases:**
  - Digital wills
  - Time-locked escrow deposits
  - Scheduled recurring payments
  - Lightning Network (Bitcoin layer 2)

**Status:** ✅ Activated in Bitcoin in December 2015

### 🔄 BIP 125: Replace-by-Fee (RBF)

**Link:** [BIP 125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki)

Controversial but important proposal that allows:

- **Transaction replacement:** Users can replace unconfirmed transactions with versions paying higher fees
- **Faster confirmation:** Useful when the network is congested
- **Fee control:** Greater flexibility to adjust transaction costs

**Controversy:** Some argue that RBF makes "zero confirmation" transactions more difficult

**Status:** ✅ Implemented in Bitcoin Core since 2016

### 🕐 OpenTimestamps (2016)

**Website:** [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org/)

Todd founded and developed OpenTimestamps, a decentralized timestamping protocol that:

- **Verifies document existence** at a specific moment
- **Uses Bitcoin blockchain** as an immutable record
- **Is free and open source**
- **Applications:**
  - Intellectual property protection
  - Audit verification
  - Legal proof of existence
  - File integrity

### 🎨 Colored Coins

Worked on early development of **Colored Coins**, precursors to today's tokens and NFTs on blockchain.

### 🔐 Other Contributions

- **Tree Chains:** Proposals for Bitcoin scalability
- **TXO Commitments:** Blockchain size optimization
- **Security auditing:** Review of multiple crypto projects
- **Privacy research:** Improvements in confidential transactions

## 🎭 Philosophy and Approach

### 😈 Bitcoin's "Devil's Advocate"

Peter Todd is known in the community for being **intentionally critical and controversial:**

- **Questions popular ideas** to test their soundness
- **Focus on security** over convenience
- **Adversarial thinking:** Always looking for vulnerabilities
- **Public debates:** Not afraid to express unpopular opinions

### 🏛️ Technical Principles

- **Decentralization first:** Prioritizes censorship resistance
- **Simplicity:** Prefers elegant and minimalist solutions
- **Security over scalability:** Better to go slow but safe
- **Code is law:** Mathematics and cryptography over trust

## 🎬 The HBO Documentary Controversy (2024)

### 📺 "Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery"

In **October 2024**, director Cullen Hoback premiered a documentary on HBO that speculatively identified Peter Todd as **Satoshi Nakamoto**, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator.
