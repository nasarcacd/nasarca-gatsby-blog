### React Basics

### React Route and Routing

### Styled Component

Styled Components allow you to write plain CSS in your components without worrying about class name collisions. It helps to write CSS that's scoped to a single component and does not leak to any other element in the page.

### Redux

React Redux is the official React binding for Redux. It lets your React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.

### Sagas

redux-saga is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.
