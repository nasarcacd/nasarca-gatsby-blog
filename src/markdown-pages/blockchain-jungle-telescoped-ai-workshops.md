## 1. Beyond Blueprints: Using AI to Automate Architecture Definitions and Documentation 🎯

**Speaker:** Mario Lopez

The magic formula for AI-powered architecture documentation:

- Gather context → Define goals → Craft precise prompts → Review & iterate
- "A good architecture definition evolves with the applications"

**Key frameworks:**

- C4 Model
- 4+1 View Model
- Viewpoint & Perspectives
- Just Enough Documentation

## 2. From User Stories to Production Using AI ⚠️

**Speaker:** Diego Barahona

**Main insight:** "AI writes code in seconds but it rarely works in production."

- The issue is not capability—it's direction
- The missing link: workflow and alignment (input → build → test → review → deploy)
- AI needs structure like CI/CD enforces discipline
- Predictable results come from alignment
- **Solution:** Agent-OS - standards, product, specs

## 3. MongoDB - Demystify NoSQL 🗄️

**Speaker:** Luis Cordoba

**Quote:** "Data used to live in tables. Now it lives everywhere - in tweets, NFTs, LLM Embeddings, and sensor streams. And yet... we still try to fit it into rows and columns."

### Key Insights:

- **Without Data, there is no AI!**

### MongoDB Pros:

- Flexible Schema (with Schema Validation when needed)
- Horizontal Scalability (sharding)
- Excellent Developer Experience (JSON)

### MongoDB Cons:

- High Memory Usage (Higher RAM)
- Not Ideal for Complex Transactions
- Consistency Trade-offs

### Takeaways:

- Learn what NoSQL IS capable of doing
- Learn what NoSQL is NOT capable
- Don't force patterns on technologies that were not made for them
- **Stop the MongoDB Hate!** 😄

## 4. From Regulation to Innovation: Implementing AI in Finance and Healthcare ✋

**Speaker:** Rodrigo Garcia

**Main principle:** "Every decision needs a human who is accountable"

### Key Insights:

The gap between success and failure is bridgeable with the right approach:

- AI is transformative but requires strategic, measured deployment
- Assess data readiness honestly (77% rate theirs as poor)
- Start with back-office, measurable processes
- Build compliance frameworks NOW, not later
- Focus on business outcomes, not AI metrics

### Human-AI Boundary by Risk Level:

| Risk Level    | Approach                   | Examples                                           |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low Risk**  | Full automation            | Routine transactions, data classification          |
| **High Risk** | Human-in-loop + AI support | Major credit decisions, diagnoses, fraud detection |
| **Critical**  | Human-led + AI assistance  | Life-critical decisions                            |

## 5. Current State of AI 💡

**Panel:** Freddy Montes, Alfredo Bonilla, Mariano Alvarez

### The Big Question:

**Will AI replace your job?**

- **YES**, if you don't adapt
- **NO**, if you start NOW

### Key Insights:

- Best use case mentioned: More time to play guitar 🎸 (half-joking, but actually true—AI handles the grunt work)
- Not using AI today = still programming with punched cards in 2025
- Tools worth exploring: Lovable for rapid prototyping
